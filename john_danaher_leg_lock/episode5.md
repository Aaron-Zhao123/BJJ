# Cross Ashi Garami

## Introduction to the system
It is in general safer if we can put both legs inside the opponent's legs.

* Catch the secondary leg of your opponent will disable his escape
* Stronge breaking force for heel hook
* Can transform to closed wedges like senkakus

## Differences and similarities between straight and cross ashi garamis

* Similarity
    * Knee and kneeline: maintain the kneeline relationship
    * Place an extra wedge using your hand, the hand wraps behind the opponent's primary leg elbow deep to drag him back to maintin the kneeline.

* Differences
    * Two legs in front in cross ashi garami
    * Damage in the inside of the leg in cross ashi garami

## Primary and secondary legs

Most of the escape potentials come from the secondary leg
* Rotate the secondary leg
* Pummel the leg in to counter

* The solution is to control both the primary and secondary legs


## Turnout problem in cross ashi garami
* If the opponent is turning in
    * This will expose the heel
    * Transform to a outside senkaku to finish

* If the opponnet is moving straight backwards
    * Really hard to move out because of the closed wedge

* The turnout approach
    * Hide the heel

    * Knee slip

## Double leg cross ashi garami
This solves the turnout problem but creates the release problem
* Wrist deep two on one grip on the leg
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-34-21-pm-kqovpe4x.png)
* Lock up the secondary leg
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-34-48-pm-kqovpzi7.png)
* Recover knee line using underhook of the left hand

## Managing the release in double leg cross ashi garami
* Solution one: do not release (Achilles Grip)
    * Pass the arm inside and under the right arm, thumb is really close to the ankle, hand is below the ankle
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-41-30-pm-kqovyl7w.png)
    * Switch to reverse figure four grip
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-42-14-pm-kqovzjko.png)
    * Opponent has to engage the hand fight
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-42-44-pm-kqow06ms.png)
    * Switch to heel hook
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-43-14-pm-kqow0trv.png)
    
* Solution two: an alternative achiles grip
    * Free hand goes under the knee
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-47-28-pm-kqow690g.png)
    * Place the wrist near the ankle
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-48-14-pm-kqow78sc.png)
    * Throw the ankle in front, so that the heel is on the chest
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-49-03-pm-kqow89zf.png)
    * Figure four grip to finish
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-50-59-pm-kqowas3v.png)
    
* Solution three: double heel hooks
    * Grab around the carf and turn to expose the heel
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-56-12-pm-kqowhhph.png)
    * Punch through for a heel hook
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-56-56-pm-kqowifpr.png)
    * Transform the initial bite to a figure four grip
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-57-50-pm-kqowjljb.png)
    * Place the elbow to the primary leg and point towards opponent's hip
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-59-02-pm-kqowl55w.png)
    * Opponent will have to turn to the direction of the heel hook, attack the primary leg and the inside senkaku to block turning
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-3-59-53-pm-kqowm84f.png)
    
* Solution four: direct attack on primary leg

## Managing the release using splitter hand and splitter elbow
    
* Lift and insert a splitter hand
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-07-04-pm-kqowvged.png)
* Lock up heel hook on primary leg
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-07-38-pm-kqoww739.png)

The secondary leg introduces an interference problem

* Solution one: Knee crunch with splitter hand
    * The opponent will try to insert the secondary leg to amplify the interence problem
    * Use the left knee to push the secondary leg out
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-10-15-pm-kqowzjpz.png)

    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-13-59-pm-kqox4cgk.png)
    * Lifting method to expose the heel

    * Establish the over and under control, hold the primary leg using the left hand
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-21-30-pm-kqoxe0nu.png)
    * Easy transition to inside heel hook
    ![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-22-03-pm-kqoxepxv.png)

## Shared spiral in cross ashi garami
When we do not have the secondary leg, the opponent will turnout
* Left hand hold inside the thigh
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-30-08-pm-kqoxp4dm.png)
* Put elbow in the inside position
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-32-16-pm-kqoxrwhe.png)
* Put the head on the floor when rolling, and place a sticky hook
![](screen-shot-2021-07-04-at-4-33-24-pm-kqoxtc38.png)
